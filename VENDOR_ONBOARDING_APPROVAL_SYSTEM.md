## Security (RLS Policies)

### Row Level Security Implementation
**Location:** `supabase/migrations/20251014070000_vendor_applications_rls_policies.sql`

All tables have comprehensive RLS policies to ensure proper data access control.

### vendor_applications Policies

#### 1. Applicants Can View Own Applications
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own vendor applications"
  ON vendor_applications FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### 2. Level-Based Access for Employees
Each hierarchy level can only see applications at their stage:

**Field Officers (Level 1):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Field Officers can view pending and fo_review applications"
  ON vendor_applications FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM employees
      WHERE employees.user_id = auth.uid()
        AND employees.hierarchy_level = 1
        AND employees.can_approve_vendors = true
    )
    AND status IN ('pending', 'fo_review')
  );
```

**Managers (Level 2):**
- Can view: manager_review, fo_review, pending

**Directors (Level 3):**
- Can view: director_review, manager_review, fo_review, pending

**Admins (Level 4-5):**
- Can view: ALL applications

#### 3. Update Permissions
Each level can only update applications at their stage:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Field Officers can update applications at their level"
  ON vendor_applications FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- Can access applications at their level
    EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM employees WHERE ...)
    AND status IN ('pending', 'fo_review')
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Must still be authorized after update
    EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM employees WHERE ...)
  );
```

Similar policies for Manager, Director, and Admin levels.

### vendor_approval_history Policies

#### 1. Employees Can View History
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Employees can view approval history"
  ON vendor_approval_history FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM employees
      WHERE employees.user_id = auth.uid()
        AND employees.is_active = true
    )
  );
```

#### 2. Employees Can Insert Records
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Employees can insert approval records"
  ON vendor_approval_history FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM employees
      WHERE employees.id = approved_by
        AND employees.user_id = auth.uid()
        AND employees.can_approve_vendors = true
    )
  );
```

### notifications Policies

```sql
-- Users can view their own notifications
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own notifications"
  ON notifications FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can mark notifications as read
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own notifications"
  ON notifications FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- System can create notifications for any user
CREATE POLICY "System can create notifications for any user"
  ON notifications FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);
```

### vendors Policies

```sql
-- Vendors can view their own record
CREATE POLICY "Vendors can view their own record"
  ON vendors FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Admins can create vendor records (during approval)
CREATE POLICY "Admins can create vendor records"
  ON vendors FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM employees
      WHERE employees.user_id = auth.uid()
        AND employees.hierarchy_level >= 4
    )
  );
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Applications Not Visible in Dashboard

**Symptom:** Employee cannot see any applications

**Possible Causes:**
- Employee hierarchy_level not set correctly
- can_approve_vendors flag is false
- RLS policies not applied
- No applications at employee's approval stage

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check employee configuration
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';

-- Verify can_approve_vendors is true
UPDATE employees
SET can_approve_vendors = true
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';

-- Check if RLS policies exist
SELECT * FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'vendor_applications';
```

#### 2. Approval Action Fails

**Symptom:** Error when trying to approve/reject application

**Possible Causes:**
- Employee doesn't have permission for current application status
- Application already processed
- Database constraint violation

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check application status
SELECT status, current_approval_stage
FROM vendor_applications
WHERE id = 'application-id';

-- Verify employee can act on this status
SELECT hierarchy_level, can_approve_vendors
FROM employees
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';
```

#### 3. Vendor Account Not Created

**Symptom:** Application approved but vendor account doesn't exist

**Possible Causes:**
- createVendorAccount function failed
- Missing partner_type in partner_types table
- User profile not found

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check if vendor was created
SELECT * FROM vendors
WHERE application_id = 'application-id';

-- Check for errors in error_logs table
SELECT * FROM error_logs
WHERE resource_id = 'application-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Manually create vendor if needed
-- (Use the VendorApprovalService.createVendorAccount private method)
```

#### 4. Notifications Not Sent

**Symptom:** Employees/applicants not receiving notifications

**Possible Causes:**
- Trigger functions not working
- No active employees at target level
- Notification insertion failed

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check if triggers exist
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger
WHERE tgname LIKE '%notify%';

-- Check notifications table
SELECT * FROM notifications
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Verify employees at target level
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE hierarchy_level = 2
  AND can_approve_vendors = true
  AND is_active = true;
```

#### 5. Application Number Not Generated

**Symptom:** Application submitted without application_number

**Possible Causes:**
- Trigger function not working
- Manual insert bypassed trigger

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check if trigger exists
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger
WHERE tgname = 'trigger_auto_application_number';

-- Manually generate if needed
UPDATE vendor_applications
SET application_number = generate_application_number()
WHERE application_number IS NULL;
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Index Creation
```sql
-- Add indexes for better query performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_vendor_applications_user_id
ON vendor_applications(user_id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_vendor_applications_status_stage
ON vendor_applications(status, current_approval_stage);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_approval_history_application
ON vendor_approval_history(application_id, created_at DESC);
```

#### Query Optimization
```sql
-- Use with proper indexes for fast filtering
SELECT * FROM vendor_applications
WHERE status = 'manager_review'
  AND current_approval_stage = 2
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```
