## Migration Instructions

### For Existing Installations

If you have an existing database with the old schema:

```sql
-- 1. Backup your data first!
-- 2. Drop unused tables (optional - they don't hurt if left alone)
-- 3. Run the new migration to ensure all tables exist

-- Or simply start fresh with the new migration
```

### For New Installations

Simply run the new migration:

```sql
-- Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
-- Copy and paste: supabase/migrations/20250115_clean_production_schema.sql
-- Execute
