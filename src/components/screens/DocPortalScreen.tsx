**Frontend:**
- Web Application: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React.
- Mobile Application: React Native with Expo, TypeScript, React Navigation, Expo Location, Expo Notifications.

**Backend:** (Assumed based on typical Bolt projects, as backend details are not in provided READMEs)
- Node.js/Express.js or similar for API layer.
- Supabase for database, authentication, and edge functions.

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL (via Supabase) for structured data storage.`

- Primarily use Tailwind CSS utility classes for rapid UI development and responsive design.
- Custom CSS should be minimal and used only for complex, non-utility-based styles.

**Mobile Application:**
- Use \`StyleSheet.create\` for defining styles to optimize performance in React Native.
- Adhere to platform design guidelines (Material Design for Android, Human Interface Guidelines for iOS).`
