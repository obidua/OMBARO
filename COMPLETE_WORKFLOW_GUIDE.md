  .from('therapist_assignments')
  .insert({
    therapist_id: therapistId,
    vendor_id: vendorId,
    customer_id: customerId,

```typescript
// Update assignment status
await supabase
  .from('therapist_assignments')
  .update({ status: 'in_progress' })
  .eq('id', assignmentId);

setInterval(async () => {
  const position = await getCurrentPosition();
  await supabase
    .from('therapist_locations')
    .insert({
      therapist_id: therapistId,
      latitude: position.latitude,
      longitude: position.longitude,
