- Vendors can view bookings for their business
- Vendors can manage their therapists and services
- Vendors can view their payouts and commissions

### Therapist Policies

## Performance Optimizations

### Indexes
- **Primary Keys**: All tables have UUID primary keys
- **Foreign Keys**: Indexed for join performance

- **Geographic**: GiST indexes for location queries
- **Time-series**: Indexes on date/time columns for bookings
- **Status**: Partial indexes on active/pending records

### Query Optimizations

- Covering indexes for common access patterns
- Partitioning strategy ready for growth

### Caching Strategy
- User sessions cached in Redis
- Service catalog cached
- Real-time data not cached
- Cache invalidation on updates

---

## Data Integrity

### Foreign Key Constraints
- **ON DELETE CASCADE**: For dependent data (e.g., booking_items)
- **ON DELETE RESTRICT**: For referenced data (e.g., bookings in payments)
- **ON DELETE SET NULL**: For optional references

### Check Constraints
- Enum-based status fields
- Rating values between 1-5
- Date range validations
- Percentage validations

### Generated Columns

# Run: supabase/migrations/20250115_clean_production_schema.sql
```

### 2. Verify Installation
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
-- Should return 60
```

### 3. Test RLS
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND rowsecurity = true;
-- Should show all user-facing tables
```
